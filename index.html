      <p>Lime Chicken infused with garlicky, savoury lime flavours! <strong>The trick to getting depth of flavour</strong> in a simple lime marinade is to use soy sauce for saltiness, plus a touch of sugar for great caramelisation. Fabulous for a quick midweek meal and ESPECIALLY great for the BBQ! Bonus: super healthy at less than 300 calories for a whole chicken breast.</p>

      <h3>Lime Marinade for Chicken</h3>
      <p>The trick with fresh citrus based marinades is getting depth of flavour into it. <i>If you just use lime juice, salt and garlic, the flavour is quite flat and the chicken – especially if using chicken breast</i> – will lack something (because breast has virtually no fat, and fat = flavour).</p>

      <h3>What to serve with Lime Chicken</h3>
      <p>The Lime Marinade makes the chicken juicy on the inside and injects with flavour so you won’t need a sauce with it. And after resting the chicken for a few minutes before serving it, some of those juices will sweat to the surface, like you see below.

As for what to serve on the side, here are a few suggestions!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lime Coconut Rice (pictured below) – lime overload?? Nope! Lime tastes different when cooked with the chicken vs in a coconut rice. </li>
        <li>Keeping with the healthy theme, serve this with Creamy Mashed Cauliflower</li>
        <li>Lemon Potato Salad (bright lemon flavours!) – or everybody’s favourite creamy Bacon Potato Salad</li>
        <li>Leafy greens with French Dressing or Balsamic Dressing</li>
      </ul>
